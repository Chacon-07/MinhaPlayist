        <h1> WISH YOU WERE HERE </h1>
           <p> So, so you think you can tell <br>
            Heaven from hell?<br>
            Blue skies from pain?<br>
            Can you tell a green field<br>
            From a cold steel rail? <br>
            A smile from a veil? <br>
            Do you think you can tell? <br>
            Did they get you to trade <br>
            Your heroes for ghosts? <br>
            Hot ashes for trees? <br>
            Hot air for a cool breeze <br>?
            Cold comfort for change? <br>
            Did you exchange <br>
            A walk on part in the war <br>
            For a lead role in a cage? <br>
             <br>
            How I wish, how I wish you were here <br>
            We're just two lost souls <br>
            Swimming in a fish bowl <br>
            Year after year <br>
            Running over the same old ground <br>
            What have we found? <br>
            The same old fears <br>
            Wish you were here </p>
