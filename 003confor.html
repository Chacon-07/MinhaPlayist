        <h1> CONFORTABLY NUMB</h1>
           <p>
                    Hello? (Hello? Hello? Hello?) <br>
                    Is there anybody in there? <br>
                    Just nod if you can hear me <br>
                    Is there anyone home? <br>
                    Come on now <br>
                    I hear you're feeling down <br>
                    Well I can ease your pain <br>
                    Get you on your feet again <br>
                    Relax <br>
                    I'll need some information first <br>
                    Just the basic facts <br>
                    Can you show me where it hurts? <br>
                     <br>
                    There is no pain you are receding <br>
                    A distant ship smoke on the horizon <br>
                    You are only coming through in waves <br>
                    Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying <br>
                    When I was a child I had a fever <br>
                    My hands felt just like two balloons <br>
                    Now I've got that feeling once again <br>
                    I can't explain you would not understand <br>
                    This is not how I am <br>
                    I have become comfortably numb <br>
                    I have become comfortably numb <br>
                     <br>
                    Okay (okay, okay, okay) <br>
                    Just a little pinprick <br>
                    There'll be no more, ah <br>
                    But you may feel a little sick <br>
                    Can you stand up? <br>
                    I do believe it's working, good <br>
                    That'll keep you going through the show <br>
                    Come on it's time to go <br>
                     <br>
                    There is no pain you are receding <br>
                    A distant ship, smoke on the horizon <br>
                    You are only coming through in waves <br>
                    Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying <br>
                    When I was a child <br>
                    I caught a fleeting glimpse <br>
                    Out of the corner of my eye <br>
                    I turned to look but it was gone <br>
                    I cannot put my finger on it now <br>
                    The child is grown <br>
                    The dream is gone <br>
                    I have become comfortably numb <br>
