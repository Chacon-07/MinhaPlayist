        <h1> MONEY</h1>
           <p>
                Money, get away <br>
                Get a good job with good pay and you're okay <br>
                Money, it's a gas <br>
                Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash <br>
                New car, caviar, four star daydream <br>
                Think I'll buy me a football team <br>
                <br>
                Money, get back <br>
                I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack <br>
                Money, it's a hit <br>
                Don't give me that do goody good bullshit <br>
                I'm in the high-fidelity first class traveling set <br>
                And I think I need a Lear jet <br>
                <br>
                Money, it's a crime <br>
                Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie <br>
                Money, so they say <br>
                Is the root of all evil today <br>
                But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're <br>
                Giving none away, away, away <br>
